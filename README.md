### Features

- **Conditional AI:** The chatbot incorporates conditional AI for dynamic and context-aware interactions.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Leverages OpenAI's API and OpenAIEmbeddings for context-rich embeddings.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes text splitting and embedding techniques for enhanced understanding.
- **Document Retrieval:** FAISS enables efficient document retrieval based on user queries.
- **Question Answering (QA) Chain:** Combines OpenAI's LLM and custom logic for generating targeted answers.
